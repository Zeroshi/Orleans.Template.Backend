# Orleans.Template.Backend
Orleans template for backend


This was orginally the Orleans API template and is being broken apart from its client. Couchbase will be added. Currently connecting to a SQL DB. 

Interfaces will be moved to a seperate repo and will be cusumed from a nuget feed so that the client and the backend have matching interfaces. 

DockerFile was also added.
